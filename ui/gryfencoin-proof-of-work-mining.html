            <h1>Proof Of Work: Mining</h1>

            <article>

                <p class="txt">Gryfencoin has a maximum amount of initial Proof of Work coins of 100 Trillion coins. The
                    highest projection for number of coins entering the supply in the first year wouldn't even see 100
                    Trillion Coins- so there is plenty of room for growth. GryfenCoin tries to differentiate itself from
                    a lot of the other coins and is CPU minable only with the initial Triple X 28.5K - X13 Mod Proof of
                    Work algorithm.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">The 250 Billion coin premine is not for GryfenCrypto but rather to pay out traders that
                    are using the Gryfx.com options market, and there is a hard cap on the supply of 5% of the coins -
                    so we would never pose a threat to the ecosystem. If we were to receive any more coins when we were
                    full the resulting coins would be burned and taken out of circulation only to be mined by someone
                    else sometime in the future.

                </p>

                <p class="txt">In Gryfencoin the mining transaction fees are slightly different. Only half of the fees
                    go back to the miners that are maintaining the block chain. One fourth go directly back into the
                    House Gryfx.com Premine account and the remaining fourth are dispursed to qualified users via the
                    super faucet.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">Superblocks are a key feature in Gryfencoin and they occur with random frequency,
                    variation and size. Block Bonus zones increase the take on the block by between 2x-7x, even if there
                    is a Superblock. The block reward in Gryfencoin is unstable and fluctuates rapidly and wildly.</p>

                <p class="text">Another trick used to try to keep the supply down is the 0.01% Transaction burn. Any
                    time you make a transaction you burn 0.01% of the coins sent in addition to the confirmation fee you
                    may or may not pay.
                </p>

                <p class="text">If a Proof of Stake block is destroyed it is converted into a Proof of Work block that
                    has been taken out of supply and appended to the blockchain; increasing the supply limit of Proof of
                    Work ever so slightly.</p>

                <p class="text">You can take coins that you mine and trade directly onto Gryfx.com or you can keep the
                    coins you mine inside of the wallet to start staking and receiving the super faucet coins.

                <p><strong>Why an X13 Mod?</strong><br><br> Our Algorithm uses the insanely popular X13 algorithm -
                    extremely secure and energy efficient (compared to SHA-256 and others), but to differentiate
                    ourselves from the horde of clone X13 PoW/PoS coins we add an extra twist to it.<br><br>
                    Every block there are <strong>4 algorithms chosen at random</strong>, with duplicity, for only 4
                    rounds of hashing compared to the traditional 13. Functionally this doesn't sacrifice much but it is
                    more energy efficient and arguably just as effective at securing a blockchain. There's a possibility
                    of 28,561 combinations of hashing.</p><br>
